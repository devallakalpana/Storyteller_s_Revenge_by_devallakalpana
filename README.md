In This Project Footage is provided by Udacity where we can stich, edit and compose the 360 video through premier Pro and Kolor autopano software. 
In this project I built a 360 video player with contorols to play and pause the video with play button and pause button. Also impletmented Home button to Replay the application  and exit button to quit the appication .

And also added particle effects in the form of stars to the intro scene to get the depth of the scene.
